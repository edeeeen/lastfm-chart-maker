# lastfm-chart-maker
Create a lastfm chart with python.  This is basically a complete compy of https://tapmusic.net/ and they host it and it is probably better so I would probably just use that instead if I were you.  

## Setup
First put your last.fm API key in the quotes on line 7
```KEY = "PUT KEY HERE"```

You can get an API key for yourself [here.](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)

Then grab your API key from [here] (https://www.last.fm/api/accounts) once you get your api account.

Install the python requirements
```pip -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

Run main.py and select your options chart size, the time frame, and if you want a playcount.

In the folder you run the script your chart will be created as `main.py`
